# MachineLearning_Project

Project for MIT class 15.095 - Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens

Each folder contains the respective part of the project:
- See "presentation" for the class presentation and 8-page report. Starting from there is suggested to have a clear overview of the project.
- "data" contains all the datasets used throughout the project.
- "preprocessing" has the code for all the data cleaning and feature engineering.
- In "code" there are the  Machine Learning models for prediction (some in Python, others in Julia), clustering (Julia) and the prescription part (Julia). 
  Moreover, there are two sub-folders where the prediction outputs and the models are saved.
- "visualization" has all the plots from prediction and prescription parts
